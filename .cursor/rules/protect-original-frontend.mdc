# Protect Original Frontend

**CRITICAL RULE: NEVER EDIT THE `old-frontend-only` DIRECTORY**

The `old-frontend-only` directory contains the user's original frontend design that must be preserved as reference material.

## Restrictions
- **NEVER** use any edit tools on files within `old-frontend-only/`
- **NEVER** delete, move, or modify anything in `old-frontend-only/`
- **ONLY** read files from `old-frontend-only/` for reference purposes

## Purpose
This directory serves as the authoritative reference for:
- Original component designs and architecture
- Visual styling and UX patterns  
- Theme system and CSS variables
- Mobile-first responsive design patterns
- Component hierarchy and data flow

## Usage
- Use `read_file` to understand original implementations
- Reference original designs when restoring/updating current frontend
- Maintain visual and architectural consistency with original design
- Preserve the user's intended UX and aesthetic choices

The current frontend should match the visual design and component structure from `old-frontend-only/` while integrating with the new database backend.
